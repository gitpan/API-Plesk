API-Plesk version 1.00
======================

The given module is intended for interaction with the XML API of the Plesk hosting panel. API is realized not completely, but there is a full support of operations with Account, Domains and Templates. Also there is a module Net::Plesk, but there were censures on its flexibility and expansibility therefore this has been written.

API::Plesk module gives the convenient interface for addition of new functions. Extensions represent modules in a folder Plesk with definitions of demanded functions. Each demanded operation is described by two functions: op and op_response_parse. The first sub generates XML query to Plesk, the second is responsible for parse XML answer and its representation in Perl Native Structures. As a template for a writing of own expansions is better to use API/Plesk/Account.pm. In module API::Plesk::Methods we can find service functions for a writing our extensions.
